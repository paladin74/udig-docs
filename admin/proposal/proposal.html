<p>This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and
scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse
community. Please send all feedback to the

<h2>Background</h2>

<!-- 
	Optionally provide the background that has lead you to creating this project.
 -->

<h2>Scope</h2>

<!-- 
	All projects must have a well-defined scope. Describe, concisely, what
	is in-scope and (optionally) what is out-of-scope. An Eclipse project
	cannot have an open-ended scope.
 -->

<p>The scope of uDig is to:</p>

<!-- WTB: "Mapping" seems too generic and meaningless. Perhaps this is because I don't live in the space.
What sorts of things does uDig enable users/adopters to do? -->
<!-- JG: that is our traditional scope definition from the initial project plan. Let me try and 
translate... 

DESKTOP GIS
Well frankly the goal is to build a Desktop GIS so I will write that down. The answer
however will not help - since what a GIS does is simialr to what a word processor does. Different
professionals will use the tool for different uses. The actual utility depends on the data
being used. As an example the same network traversal functionality can be used for water managements,
SCADA system planning, road maintenance, enivornmental analysis and so on.

GIS Platform SDK
We want to bundle up all this stuff for normal Eclipse RCP developers. Drop in GIS
components with clear documented integration path for developers used to working on a normal
buisness domain model. 

LOCAL AND EXTERNAL DATA
How to put this bluntly. GIS professionals are still not used to the internet, most of the web
service standards die when presented with GIS data volumes. The fact that we consider both
local and external data (let alone OGC standard support) is still fairly unusual.

-->

<ul>
<li><b>Produce a Desktop Geographic Information System (GIS) using Eclipse RCP technology.</b>
    A Desktop GIS application is a general purpose tool, similar to a wordprocessor, that can
    be put to a wide range of uses. Often the only limitation is the ingenuity of the operator
    and the data information they have available to work with.
    <p>
    The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">Wikipedia entry for
    Geographic Information System</a> provides the following:
    <ul>
    <li>Relating information from different sources</li>
    <li>GIS uncertainties</li>
    <li>Data Representation</li>
    <li>Data Capture: ranging from digitisation to automated techniques</li>
    <li>Raster to vector conversation</li>
    <li>Projection, coordinate systems and registration</li>
    <li>spatial analysis with GIS</li>
    <li>Data output and Cartography</li>
    <li>Graphical display and techniques</li>
    <li>Spatial ETL</li>
    <li>GIS Data Mining</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</li>
    
<li><b>Provide Eclipse RCP developers an SDK of GIS components.</b> Used by business applications
    for integration spatial information, rendering or display servies, and in-depth spatial analysis.
    Allow the business domain model to be extended with minimal background knowledge in mapping.
    Enable business applications to add "just enough" GIS to get the job done.</li>
<li><b>Enable integration of local and external spatial data sources</b>. The rich history, and unusual
    size, of spatial data presents a great integration challenge. To be effective uDig must remain
    data provider, and data format, neutral. Respecting where organisations store their
    information while leveraging international (ISO TC211) and industry (OGC) standards for
    interoperability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe the project here. Be concise, but provide enough information that
	somebody who doesn't already know very much about your project idea or domain
	has at least a fighting chance of understanding its purpose.
 -->

<p>uDig is an open source desktop application framework, built with Eclipse Rich Client (RCP) technology. uDig provides
a complete Java solution for desktop GIS data access, editing, and viewing.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>U</b>ser friendly: familiar graphical environment for GIS users;</li>
	<li><b>D</b>esktop appliation: running as a thick client, natively user interface on Windows, Mac OS/X and Linux</li>
	<li><b>I</b>nternet: supporting standard (WMS, WFS, WCS,KML) and de facto (GeoRSS, tiles) geospatial web services</li>
	<li><b>G</b>IS: framework for spatial data exploration and analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why LocationTech?</h2> 

<!-- 
	What value does this project bring to the LocationTech
	community? What value do you expect to obtain from hosting your project at LocationTech?

 -->
<p>The uDig project brings LocationTech an established Eclipse RCP GIS solution with a strong focus on ease-of-use and
integration.</p>

<p>The uDig project is well known in the spatial software community and is taking this opportunity to join LocationTech as an outreach
to Eclipse RCP developers.</p>

<h2>Legal Issues</h2>

<!-- 
	Please describe any potential legal issues in this section. Does somebody else
	own the trademark to the project name? Is there some issue that prevents you
	from licensing the project under the Eclipse Public License? Are parts of the 
	code available under some other license? Are there any LGPL/GPL bits that you
	absolutely require?
 -->

<p>The project includes "GeoTools" components of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation made available under
an LGPL license. Other noted dependencies are the Java extensions JAI, ImageIO and ImageIO-Ext.</p>

<p>The use of LGPL components has been negotiated with the LocationTech industry working group and
does not represent an issue.</p>

	List any initial committers that should be provisioned along with the
	new project. Include affiliation, but do not include email addresses at
	this point.

<h2>Initial Contribution</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe any initial contributions of code that will be brought to the 
	project. If there is no existing code, just remove this section.
 -->
<p>The initial contribution will be made by the uDig Project Steering Committee. Code ownership is held
by Refractions Research under the direction of the uDig Project Steering Committee. Additional
"jgrass" plugins made available by HydroloGIS. This is an established development community with
world wide representation, drawn from a number of organisations.</p>

<p>
<b>GIS Platform</b>: provides a local catalog of spatial services, with minimal Dublin Core details
supplemented with a spatial extent. Each listed item implements <b>IResolve</b> operating in a
similar fashion to <b>IAdaptable</b> with the additional expectation of both latency and IOErrors.
Implementations are provided to work with a range of spatial services from popular file formats,
through to spatial databases (such as PostGIS, DB2 and Oracle) and of Open Geospaital 
Consortium web servies (Web Feature Server, Web Map Server).
</p>
<p>
<b>GIS Application</b> provides an EMF model for Project, Map and Layer with an implementation
of <b>MapViewer</b> to facilitate embedding a map component in RCP apps. This forms the core
of the example uDig application we make available to show case the SDK capabilities.
</p>
<p>
Additional contributions cover raster processing and analysis (ie JGrass), printing and integration.
</p>

<h2>Mentors</h2>
